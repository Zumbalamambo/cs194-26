# CS194-26: Image Warping and Mosaicing
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore some additional imaging techniques. In particular, I chose to attempt the vertigo shot as well as applying tilt shift effects to images.
## Accessing the Code
By running the main.py file, you will run the tilt shift algorithm. To change the image that you want to apply the tilt shift effect on, simply change the filename.
## Code Breakdown
This project does the following:
- Creates a horizontal mask
- Generates a gaussian stack
- Applies the tilt shift effect
